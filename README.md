This is a mod for Satisfactory that notifies users in-game when one or more installed mods have updates available. The source code here is free to use for your own projects, though I'd prefer if you didn't just redistribute the mod.

Jetbrains has provided me a free copy of their software for developing my mods, so huge thanks to them! You can check out their software here: https://www.jetbrains.com, or get a free copy for your open-source projects here: https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource
